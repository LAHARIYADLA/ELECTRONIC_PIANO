# ELECTRONIC_PIANO
In this project, you will turn the Arduino into a Piano! This piano have 2 function, 2 octaves usual piano, and Practice mode, which user can practice hearing. This training are in the form of 3 type of question, Easy, Medium, and Hard. If the user presses one of these question buttons, the Piano will make sound of several notes, and the user must play the notes as they heard. If the user answers correctly, the green LED will light up. However, if the user answers incorrectly, the red LED will light up.

In this project, Arduino use push button as the notes input through analog pin A3-A5. For the speaker, we will use Piezo buzzer in Tinkercad.
